Install this package and open the developer section in Umbraco again. You will see the Package Migrations tester tab. When you click on this tab you will see an overview where you can select a package. This will show an overview with all available migrations and the option to execute the up/down methods. Add a debugger to your code and debugging migrations is a lot easier now.
