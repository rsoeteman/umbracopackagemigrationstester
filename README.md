# Umbraco Packagemigrations tester
Test utility for Umbraco package migrations.

Install this package and open the settings section in Umbraco again. You will see the Package Migrations tester tab. When you click on this tab you will see an overview where you can select an assembly. This will show an overview with all available migrations and the option to execute the the migration. Add a debugger to your code and debugging migrations is a lot easier now.
